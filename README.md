#GolfClubDBMS
This project is a web application which manages a golf club. Users are able to
create an account and log in to view extra information about the club. Once a 
user creates an account, their information is inserted into a database which
is then retrieved when a user attempts to login. The frontend of the project
was created with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and the backend of the project was
created with PHP and SQL.
